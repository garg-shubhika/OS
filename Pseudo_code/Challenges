We faced several different challenges:

1. We changed the architecture around five times due to implementing different functionalities like creating a basic structure, then implementing structure with ball picker, a structure with add-on features of ball launcher and compass for navigation.

2. We faced issues with compass angles initially as it was sensing wrong values.

3. We also faced issues in our object_scan function where the sensing of the ball was behaving differenly in the arena and the outside normal floor.

4. Issues with ultra-sonic sensor where the ball-picker arm was becoming an obstactle in it's path and it gave wrong values on executing.
